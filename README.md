# Description
The primary target audience of the application are people who are looking to buy a house in the Philippines whether they wish to live in it or rent it out for passive income. Another type of audience, albeit not as prioritized for this project, are people who simply wish to explore data regarding houses and/or earthquakes in the Philippines for their personal enjoyment. 

Buying a house is a very important financial decision that a person has to make especially considering the amount of money involved combined with today’s economy. Whether you’re starting a family or just interested in having your own place, it’s expected that you would want your safe space to be, well, safe. Fires, floods, landslides, and other disasters will only take hours to send decades of hard work to waste. This application can serve as a great tool in a prospective homeowner’s arsenal in making this important decision, integrating house pricing data with earthquake data.

The extent of the average person’s knowledge regarding occurrences of earthquakes in his vicinity may be a word of mouth of “There’s an active fault line in X.” and nothing more. Similarly, his knowledge of real estate pricing may be limited to “Land is expensive in Y.” This makes the first step in deciding to buy a home a rather daunting task. Admittedly, readily available sources are either hard to come by or are just a hassle to browse. By creating a tool where users get a consolidated view of empirical earthquake and housing data, more meaningful insights can be drawn which can drive this vital decision.
